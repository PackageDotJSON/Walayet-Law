                        </div>
                        <p> Dispute resolution is an indispensable process for making social
                            life peaceful. Dispute resolution process tries to resolve and check
                            conflicts, which enables persons and group to maintain co-operation. It
                            can thus be alleged that it is the sin qua non of social life and security of
                            the social order, without which it may be difficult for the individuals to
                            carry on the life together. <br />
                            
                            Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a term used to describe
                            several different modes of resolving legal disputes. It is experienced by
                            the business world as well as common men that it is impracticable for
                            many individuals to file law suits and get timely justice. The Courts are
                            backlogged with dockets resulting in delay of year or more for the parties
                            to have their cases heard and decided. To solve this problem of delayed
                            justice ADR Mechanism has been developed in response thereof.
