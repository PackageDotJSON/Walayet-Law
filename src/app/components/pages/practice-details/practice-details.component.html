                        <p> The courts grant physical rights to one parent, however increased number of cases have seen shared legal responsibility and guardianship of any child(ren). Thus custodial laws in Pakistan can also be classified as physical and legal. </p>

                        <p> While dealing with such issues, the court considers the preference of the minor in question, if he/she is old enough to form an intelligent preference. </p>
                            
                        <p> Traditionally in Pakistan, mothers were given ownership of minor, but the trend has been showing signs of change. More and more women are opting for career-driven lives, which may not enable them to bring up their children as a single parent. </p>
